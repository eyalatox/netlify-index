## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Fails**
- Check Node.js version (requires 18.17.0+)
- Verify all dependencies installed
- Check for TypeScript/ESLint errors

**Pages Not Loading**
- Verify `netlify.toml` redirects
- Check static export configuration
- Ensure all dynamic routes have `generateStaticParams`

**Images Not Loading**
- Confirm `images.unoptimized: true` in `next.config.js`
- Verify image paths are correct
- Check public folder structure

**Styling Issues**
- Ensure Tailwind CSS is building correctly
- Verify all CSS imports are working
- Check for missing font imports

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:
- [ ] Site uptime and performance
- [ ] Build status on subsequent deployments
- [ ] User analytics (if configured)
- [ ] Core Web Vitals scores
